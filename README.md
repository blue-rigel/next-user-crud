## Getting Started

Works best with node 16+

Install the Node Modules with npm
```bash
npm install
```
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack
 
 - React JS / Next JS (UI Library)
 - Tailwind (CSS library)
 - Redux (Package manager and middleware to request to server)
 - Prisma (DB management and query)
 - React Hook Form ( React based Form management Library )
 - Yup ( Object schema validation) 
 - SQLite (Local DB, autocreated by Prisma during dev)
